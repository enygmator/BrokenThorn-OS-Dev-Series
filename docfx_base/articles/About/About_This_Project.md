# About This Project

These are a series of tutorials and articles about computers and operating systems, which intend to demonstrate and teach operating system development from the ground up. The series focuses on a new direction in **developing an operating system from scratch**, whilst describing architectures and concepts that are in **system-level programming**, providing the **most comprehensive guide** in operating systems and computer systems development.

This project was created by [**Enygmator**](https://github.com/enygmator/) to provide a better user interface to navigate the OS dev series created by **BrokenThorn entertainment** and at the same time correct any grammatical, spelling or conceptual errors in the original tutorials.

> [!NOTE]
> This project in no way intends to infringe on the copyright of the series and fully attributes the original documentation/tutorial series to "BrokenThorn entertainment Co.". I am not the author of this series (which has been created with lots of expertise and effort by the original author).

I'd like to thank the original creators for creating such a great starting point for systems developers. This is certainly the best starting point resource out there (created with a lot of effort), which I myself referred to during a "conceptual" project called `Lantern OS` which you can have a look at [here] (insert link here/coming soon) which has its own documentation (unlike this series, its documentation is not a tutorial, but is actually the software (OS) documentation).

## Contributions

I would love to receive contributions to the tutorials, not only in terms of new, helpful content, but also in correcting errors, making things clearer with better wording, more links and references to other resources that might be helpful to the community members, along with improvements in the UI (if you are experienced in using DocFX, which is what we use to generate this website from DFM i.e. DocFX Flavoured MArkdown) and ANY OTHER THING that might be USEFUL!
