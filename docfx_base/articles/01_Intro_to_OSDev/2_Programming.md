# Programming Computers with Programming Languages

If you have never programmed before, we would first like to welcome you to the world of programming and computer science.

Computer scientists and software engineers use programming methods to build complex software systems that do a certain job. If you have never programmed before, you will be learning a bit of all three right from the start. This tends to make learning the first programming language difficult. However, it becomes easier to learn other programming languages over time.

It is more recommended to start with a simpler language, such as `Python`, and build on that. Then move on to `Java` or `C++` or `C#`. `Java` or `C#` is easier then `C++` but it shares a lot of its syntax, so if you pick up `Java` first, moving to `C++` would be a lot easier. In addition, by learning `C++` you are also learning a a large subset of `C`.

We recommend the following sites to learn from:

- [cprogramming.com](http://www.cprogramming.com)
- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com)
- [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/)

YouTube also has a lot of really good videos and lectures on software engineering, computer science, and programming.

> [!NOTE]
> These tutorials and links are quite old and there may be better places to learn stuff from at this point of time, like online playgrounds where you can quickly test code without setting up an development environment. For example, GeeksForGeeks, Tutorials Point, W3C. etc.
> I request you to suggest some by opening an issue in github, [here](https://github.com/enygmator/BrokenThorn-OS-Dev-Series/issues). Thanks!

> [!TIP]
> I recommend you to use an IDE (Integrated development environment) for writing code and executing it as it has a lot of benefits like syntax highlighting (colors indicating keywords and guiding you through programming), linting (Checking for all kinds of errors, warning and messages) and easier debugging/execution of computer programs. Visual Studio Code is my personal favorite. You can get it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).  
> Though it might be worth noting that we will debug a lot of stuff manually in OS development.
