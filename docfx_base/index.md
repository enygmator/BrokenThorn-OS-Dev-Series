# Operating Systems Development

Welcome!

These are a series of tutorials and articles about computers and operating systems, which intend to demonstrate and teach operating system development from the ground up. The series focuses on a new direction in **developing an operating system from scratch**, whilst describing architectures and concepts that are in **system-level programming**, providing the **most comprehensive guide** in operating systems and computer systems development.

The goal of this series is to provide the **most comprehensive guide** in operating systems and computer systems, while attempting to cover every bit of it (pun intended).

You can get to know more about this project [here](~/articles/About/About_This_Project.md).

## Disclaimer

This website aims to provide a better user interface to navigate the [OS development series](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html) created by ["BrokenThorn entertainment"](http://www.brokenthorn.com/) and at the same time correct any grammatical, spelling or conceptual errors in the **original** tutorials.

> [!NOTE]
> This project in no way intends to infringe on the copyright of the series and fully attributes the original documentation/tutorial series to "BrokenThorn entertainment Co.". I am not the author of this series (which has been created with lots of expertise and effort by the original author).

I'd like to thank the original creators for creating such a great starting point for systems developers. This is certainly the best starting point resource out there (created with a lot of effort), which I myself referred to during a "conceptual" project called `Lantern OS` which you can have a look at [here] (insert link here/coming soon) which has its own documentation (unlike this series, its documentation is not a tutorial, but is actually the software (OS) documentation).
